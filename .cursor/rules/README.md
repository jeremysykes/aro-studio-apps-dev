# Cursor Rules Entry Point

This directory contains the authoritative rules for working in this repository.

Before making any decisions or writing code:

1. Read `CURSOR_RULES.md`
2. Read `/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
3. Read `/docs/CORE_PUBLIC_API.md`

If a decision is unclear or undocumented:

- Update the relevant file in `/docs` first
- Then implement the change

Do not introduce new dependencies, structure, or abstractions without updating documentation first.
